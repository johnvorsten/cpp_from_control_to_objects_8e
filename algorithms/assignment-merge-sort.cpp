/*Write a  function that merges two sorted array-based lists 
into one sorted array-based list.  The function takes two arrays 
as parameters, each holding a sorted list of integers, merges 
them into  a single sorted list, and returns the result.  Note 
that this function performs the merge part of the merge sort algorithm.

The function should have a linear time complexity i.e. O(N), 
where N is the sum of the length of the two input lists it 
merges. Note: functions that are not linear will not get any credit.

Deliverables:

A copy of your merge function code in a text file.
A copy of a test program to test your function. Be sure to 
    test all cases e.g. two empty lists, one empty only, 
    lists with 1 element each, lists with multiple elements.
Screenshots of your test runs showing your function meets specifications.
