/*Write a class named Car that has the following member variables: 
• yearModel—an int that holds the car’s year model 
• make—a string that holds the make of the car 
• speed—an int that holds the car’s current speed

In addition, the class should have the following constructor and other 
member functions: • Constructor—The constructor should accept the car’s 
year model and make as argu? ments. These values should be assigned to 
the object’s yearModel and make member variables. The constructor should 
also assign 0 to the speed member variables.

• Accessor—appropriate accessor functions to get the values stored in an 
object’s yearModel, make, and speed member variables
• accelerate—The accelerate function should add 5 to the speed member 
variable each time it is called.

• braki The brake function should subtract 5 from the speed 
member variable each time it is called.

Demonstrate the class in a program that creates a Car object, 
then calls the accel erate function five times. After each call to 
the accelerate function, get the current speed of the car and display 
it. Then, call the brake function five times. After each call to the 
brake function, get the current speed of the car and display it.
